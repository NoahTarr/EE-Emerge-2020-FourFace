FourFace is a project developed during the 2019/2020 academic year by undergraduates from EE-Emerge a group within the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Davis. FourFace is interactive memory game where four players compete against one another by replicating randomly generated patterns. As the rounds increase, the patterns become more difficult. Once a person fails to imitate the given pattern, they are eliminated. Last person to survive the remaining rounds is crowned the winner. At the core of FourFace's technology is CapSense technology and custom PCBs.
