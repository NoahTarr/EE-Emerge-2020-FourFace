  The software app we will be using to cad the design is AutoDesk Fusion 360. A laser cutter is needed to cut the wood sheets for the 
mechanical design. If you do no have a laser cutter, a box cutter will do.
  The overall design of the of the project is a cube, where each of the four adjacent sides make up the frames. Each frame will have a 
dimension of 15x15 inch. Within each frame, there are nine 4x4 inch acrylic panels with capacitive sensing technology, ultimately acting
as a "touch screen." Each frame has four layers, each having a specific mechanical function. The acrylic panel sits on top of the first
layer and the first layer is directly above thesecond layer. The first and second layer act in conjunction with each other by creating 
a stable configuration for the panel, which is the layer above, to sit evenly on the first layer. Because the acrylic panel has the same 
dimensions as the first layer, without the second layer being slightly larger, the panels would be unable to be securely stacked. The next
layer has a specific thickness of half an inch, which is the width the the LED strip we will be using. The LED strip will run along the 
square cutouts. The final layer allows wiring management. Once one frame is done, you have to do the same procedure three more times. To 
attach the layers of the frames, we recommend using wood glue. Now once all four frames are done, you can assemble the four face together.
  
  Lets talk about the capacitive touch technology
  

- dowel
- connector
- base/tower???
