The overall design of the of the project is a cube, where each of the four adjacent sides make up the frames. Within each frame, there are 
nine acrylic panels with capacitive sensing technology, ultimately acting as a "touch screen." Each frame has four layers, each 
having a specific mechanical function. The acrylic panel sits on top of the first layer and the first layer is directly above the
second layer. The first and second layer act in conjunction with each other by creating a stable configuration for the panel, which is the
layer above, to sit evenly on the first layer. Because the acrylic panel has the same dimensions as the first layer, without the second
layer being slightly larger, the panels would be unable to be securely stacked. The next layer has a specific thickness of half an inch,
which is the width the the LED strip we will be using. The LED strip will run along the square cutouts. The final layer allows wiring 
management. Once one frame is done, you have to do the same procedure three more times. Now once all four frames are done, you can assemble
the four face together.
